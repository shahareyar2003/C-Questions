/*
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at bell lab over a period starting in 1979.
C++ was initially known as "C with classes", and renamed C++ in 1983.

1.  Variables in C++ :-
    🔯 A variable is a container to hold data.

    Types of Variables:-
        1.  Int         ("Integer value":-1,2,3434,43,-878,23,....)
        2.  Float       (-1.2,3.77,0.7,....)
        3.  Double      (1.3123432,0.565354643,....)
        4.  Char        ('A','C','c',.....)
        5.  Boolean     (True or False)

    Based on Scope, Variables can classified into two types:
        1.  Local Variables:-  Local variables are  declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only from there.
        2.  Global Variables:- Glonal variables are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere.
➡️ Preceedence:- Local variables  >>   global variables.

    Rules to declare variables:-
        1. All variables name must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(_).
        2. Variables name are case sensitive.
        3. No space or special character are allowed.
        4. Cannot use C++ keyword or reserved keyword as a variable name.

2.  Data types :-
    Data types defines the type of data a variable can hold.

    Data types are classified into three groups:-
        1. Built-in Data types:-
            a. int
            b. float
            c. char
            d. double
            e. bool 
        
        2. User defined data types:-
            a. struct
            b. union
            c. enum

        3. Derived data types:-
            a. Array
            b. function 
            c. pointer 

3.  Extraction:- The operator used for taking the input(>>).

4.  Insertion:- The operator used for displaying the output(<<).

5.  cin>> :-is used to read input from the standard input device which is usually a keyword.

6.  Operators:-
    Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
