What is Inheritance in C++?

    1.  The concept of reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance.
    2.  We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting it.
    3.  The existing class is called a base class.
    4.  The new class which is inherited from the base class is called a derived class.
    5.  Reusing classes saves time and money.


Forms of Inheritance in C++
    1. Single Inheritance:-Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a derived class is inherited with only one base class.

    2. Multiple Inheritance:- Multiple inheritances are a type of inheritance in which one derived class is inherited with more than one base class. 
    
    3. Hierarchical Inheritance:-A hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance in which several derived classes are inherited from a single base class.

    4. Multilevel Inheritance:-Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in which one derived class is inherited from another derived class.

    5. Hybrid Inheritance:-Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.

Derived Class syntax


class {{derived-class-name}} : {{visibility-mode}} {{base-class-name}}
{
    class members/methods/etc...
}
